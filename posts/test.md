# Hitman 3
The ‘World of Assassination’ trilogy comes to a triumphant close here, with Agent 47’s globetrotting extermination tour taking in six new locations. Five of these are the kind of densely detailed sadist’s sandboxes that have made IO Interactive’s recent Hitman games such a joy, all filled with ingenious tools and traps for offing the odious targets – each of whom seems thoroughly deserving of whatever sticky end you visit upon them.

There’s not a lot of genuine innovation here, it’s true (aside from the ability to play the game in VR, currently restricted to PlayStation 4 and 5 owners), but when the core gameplay is this enjoyable, who cares?

# Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury
We were a bit miffed at the slight laziness of last year’s (now extinct) Super Mario 3D All-Stars anniversary collection, which offered little more than three straight-up ports of Mario platformers past. But 2021’s Mario double pack is anything but a quick and easy cash grab.

Not only did we get Super Mario 3D World, a top tier 3D Mario game that too few people played given that it was a Wii U exclusive, but an entirely new game in Bowser’s Fury to boot. And what a marvellous little experiment it is. Its miniature open-world structure could well be a test run for a full fat open-world Mario game in the future, while the genuinely terrifying Kaiju Bowser appearances add a level of tension that feels brilliantly out of place in one of the plumber’s adventures.

Unmissable for anyone who didn’t play 3D World the first time, and more than worthy of a double dip for those who did.
